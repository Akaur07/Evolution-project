    <h1>Evolution of Dodos</h1>
    <hr/>
<p>Dodos (also known as the Raphus cucullatus) are an extinct species of flightless birds who inhabited the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. </p>

    <h2>Taxonomic Classification</h2>
    <p>Their taxonomic classification is as follows: </p>
    <img src="img/taxonomy.png" alt="taxonomy" width="300px" class="column">
    <p>Kingdom: Animalia</p>
    <p>Phylum: Chordata</p>
    <p>Class: Aves</p>
    <p>Order: Columbiformes</p>
    <p>Family: Columbidae</p>
    <p>Genus: Raphus</p>
    <p>Species: Cucullatus</p>
    <hr/>
     
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Adaptations</h2>
    <p>Structural Adaptation: They had large, hooked beaks that were adapted to the food they were able to find easily.</p>
    <img src="img/beak.png" alt="beak" width="300px" class="center">
    <p>Physiological Adaptation: Dodos had a diverse palate and could digest a variety of foods through their gizzard stones. These stones would grind up the food in their stomachs, aiding in digestion.  </p>
    <p>Behavioural Adaptation: Dodos nested on the ground because they had no natural predators on Mauritius. </p>

    <h2>Fossil Evidence</h2>
    <p>The fossil evidence is scarce for dodos and the reason mainly being that they were only found on the Mauritius island. Also their population was already in decline by the time Europeans arrived in the late 16th century. However, several fossil specimens including skulls, beaks, limb bones, and some fragments of eggshells have been discovered. Some of these fossils are believed to date around 4,000 to 2,000 years old. </p>
    <p>These fossils have helped scientists to study the appearance and biology of the dodo, including its size, shape, and likely behavior. They have provided valuable insights into the ecology and its extinction. </p>
    <p>Anatomy -  Dodo fossils, including bones and skeletal remains, provide information about the size, shape, and structure of these birds. They were large, flightless birds with robust bodies, relatively small wings, and long, sturdy legs. 
    </p>
    <p>Diet - The examination of their jaws and beaks suggests that they were likely herbivores or omnivores. They fed on a variety of vegetation, fruits, seeds and small animals. The fossils providee clues about their feeding habits and the types of foods they were capable of consuming. </p>
    <p>Habitat- The remains found in the sediment layers provides some information about the environment and their habitats that they lived in.

    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p>Due to limited direct evidence available, the exact details of dodo reproduction are not fully understood, however scientists have proposed some hypothesis about dodo reproduction. They believe that dodos formed pairs to bond and laid eggs in their nests. Since the dodos reproduced sexually, their offsprings inherited random combinations of their genes that led to genetic variation. This can be important for the adaptation of the species to the changes in the environment. Through variation, they have better chances of survival since it prevents the whole species from declining when natural selection acts upon these variations.

        <h2>Evolution Evidence</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fossils - Through examination of the fossils, scientists discovered that dodos were flightless birds. They also gave more insight into the structure of their beaks. Dodos had large hooked beaks that allowed them to consume a variety of different food sources.</li>
            <li>Biochemistry - Genetic studies have provided evidence of shared sequences and genetic markers. Through the analysis of genetic data, common ancestry between dodos and other organisms from the columbidae family has been confirmed. Pigeons and dodos are closely related and DNA tests have provided evidence for it. </li>

        <h2>Closest Living Relative</h2>
        <p>Nicobar Pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) - It is a native species to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. Even though it is not flightless like the dodo, it still shares common ecological traits to that of a dodo. These traits include nesting on the ground and feeding on food found on the forest floors. Genetic analyses and anatomy studies provide supporting evidence that there is a close relation between the two and are thought to share a common ancestry.</p>

        <h2>Lamarck and Darwin</h2>
        <p>Trait = beaks</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lamarck - When an environmental change occured, the dodos were required to use their beaks more in order to find more food that is suitable for them. As the dodos used their beaks more, they became stronger and developed into a large and hooked structure. Through more use of their beaks, they adapted to the change and acquired a larger beak. This acquired trait was passed on to the offspring, thus allowing for an evolved generation of dodos.</li>

            <li>Darwin - The population of dodos was increasing and as an environmental change occured, there was a competition for the necessary resources. Since there were scarce food resources, the dodos with larger beaks were favoured. This was because larger beaks allowed the dodos to have a diverse food palate which posed a better chance of survival due to limited resources. As the dodos with larger beaks survived, they reproduced and passed on their genetic material to the offspring. Eventually, over several generations, this trait was passed on to the offsprings which lead to the origination of a new species.</li>
